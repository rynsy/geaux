This repo contains a compiler I wrote for a graduate course on compiler construction. 

It's a pretty basic go-like language. I enjoyed working on it, so I'm going to keep
adding features. 

TODO:
* Create automated testing system. 
* Fix TODO's
* Refactor/clean-up code a bit. 
* Make list of features to add/current features to change.
